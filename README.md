# Wine-Testing : Uncorking Wine Quality: A Data Driven Approach


The project aims to delve on “How chemical composition determines the Type and Quality level of
different types of wine”. This is done through the analysis of two comprehensive datasets consisting of
data separately for white and red wine. Several advanced algorithms were applied including Decision
Trees for classifying wine type and quality level, Random Forests for observing important features, and
K-means Clustering to deep dive into observing the behavior of the model along with noting the accuracy.
The models yielded a 98.9% of accuracy for predicting wine types through a logistic regression by taking
in consideration all the chemical composition of wines. Decision trees achieved an accuracy of 93% for
classifying quality levels, and 96.1% for wine type.
The search through data also provided valuable insights, unveiling the significant influence of specific
chemical features. Random forest helped in determining Total Sulfur Dioxide as a pivotal factor in
determining both wine type and quality level. Ingredients such as chlorides and Residual Sugar
contributed majorly in describing the alcohol content.
